/**
 * The draft session, established by exchanging a signed preview assertion at
 * Drupal's token endpoint. It describes a session, not a previewed entity:
 *
 * - `path`: the session's entry point, from the assertion's claims.
 *   Navigation only — what the app previews is determined by this path and
 *   the app's own routing.
 * - `resourceVersion`: session-wide revision policy the draft client applies
 *   to every fetch, using Drupal core JSON:API's `resourceVersion` query
 *   parameter values:
 *   - `rel:working-copy` — the latest revision of each entity, whether or
 *     not it is published ("show me work-in-progress everywhere"). This is
 *     what the Drupal module sends, and the usual meaning of draft mode.
 *     Precisely: the forward revision if one exists, otherwise the
 *     default revision. A forward (or "pending") revision is a draft saved
 *     on top of a published entity — the published revision stays the
 *     default and stays live, the draft sits ahead of it awaiting
 *     publication. Never-published entities have no forward revision (their
 *     latest draft *is* the default revision), which is why they show up in
 *     collections without this parameter while forward revisions do not.
 *     Resolved live at fetch time: if an editor saves another draft
 *     mid-session, a reload shows it.
 *   - `rel:latest-version` — the latest *default* (typically published)
 *     revision, even when newer drafts exist ("preview as it would publish
 *     today"). A valid session policy the module does not currently mint.
 *   - `id:<revision-id>` — one exact revision. Inherently per-entity, so it
 *     does not make sense as a session-wide policy; a "view this historical
 *     revision" feature would carry it per fetch, not here.
 * - `sub`: the Drupal user id of the editor the session is bound to, from
 *   the assertion's `sub` claim. Renewal is *continuation*, not activation:
 *   a renewal whose assertion names a different editor (the browser's
 *   Drupal session changed hands mid-preview) is refused, so a session can
 *   never silently change identity — only an explicit new activation can.
 * - `renewUrl`: the absolute URL of Drupal's standalone renewal route, as
 *   seen by the editor's browser — a signed claim, minted from the request
 *   Drupal received, so no frontend configuration names a browser-facing
 *   Drupal URL (in multi-origin dev topologies the app's server-side base
 *   URL is a different origin). The expired banner's "Renew session" link
 *   navigates here top-level.
 * - `accessToken` / `tokenType` / `tokenExpiresAt`: the session's access
 *   token, bound to the editor who initiated the preview. Draft requests
 *   act with exactly that editor's permissions — there are no client
 *   credentials to fall back on. Before it expires, the session renews in
 *   place by redeeming a fresh assertion minted from the editor's live
 *   Drupal session; a token that expires anyway ends the session until it
 *   is renewed or re-activated from Drupal.
 * - `codeVerifier`: the PKCE verifier proving the next renewal comes from
 *   the app server. Renewal assertions transit the embedded page's script
 *   context, so Drupal only redeems them together with this verifier —
 *   which lives here, in the httpOnly cookie, out of any script's reach.
 *   Rotated on every redemption (see server/pkce.ts).
