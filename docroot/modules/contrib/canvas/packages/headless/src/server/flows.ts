     * data without a document reload. The renewed session's entry path
     * comes from the new assertion's claims: the host mints it for wherever
     * the editor currently is, so a later session recovery re-enters there,
     * not at the original entry point.
     *
     * The renewal exchange is PKCE-bound to the app server. The assertion
     * reaches this endpoint through the embedded page's script context
     * (postMessage), where an injected script could intercept it — but
     * Drupal refuses to redeem a renewal assertion without the
     * code_verifier registered at the previous redemption, and that
     * verifier lives in the httpOnly session cookie only the app server
     * reads. An intercepted assertion therefore cannot be exchanged for a
     * raw access token anywhere else; the worst an injected script can do
     * with it is POST it back here, which just renews the session normally.
     *
     * This endpoint carries no CSRF token, and the reason is narrower than
     * it once was. The request *does* consume cookie-held authority: it
     * reads the session's PKCE verifier from the httpOnly cookie, spends it
     * at Drupal, and rotates it — so this is not a pure
     * credential-in-body exchange, and a cross-site POST would carry those
     * cookies. What makes a forged request inert is that the attacker
     * cannot supply the other half: a valid, unexpired, unredeemed,
     * renewal-marked assertion, minted only by Drupal for the editor's live
     * session. Without one the exchange is refused before anything is spent
     * — Drupal validates the assertion, and the verifier's challenge,
     * before consuming either. The verifier never leaves the app server, so
     * a forged request can neither learn it nor redirect where it goes; and
     * a renewal-marked assertion is useless anywhere else, including at the
     * activation route, whose activation exchange sends no verifier and is
     * therefore refused for exactly the same reason.
     *
     * Renewal is *continuation*, so it requires a session to continue:
     * without an existing draft session (even an expired one), the request
     * is refused with 400 — starting a session is the preview URL's job,
     * and refusing here keeps this endpoint from doubling as a second
     * activation surface.
     *
     * Continuation is also identity-pinned: if the assertion names a
     * different editor than the running session (the browser's Drupal
     * session changed hands mid-preview — editor A logged out, editor B
     * logged in), the renewal is refused with 409 and the session is left
     * untouched. Without this check the session would silently continue as
     * another user, permissions and attribution included. The refusal is
     * deliberate about what happens next: the session expires on schedule
     * and the recovery lane starts a *new* session as the new editor — a
     * visible fresh start, never a silent swap. Activation intentionally
     * has no such check: a preview URL arriving as a top-level navigation
     * is an explicit new session for whoever holds the Drupal session.
