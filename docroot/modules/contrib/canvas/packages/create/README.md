# Drupal Canvas Create

CLI to scaffold a codebase for working with Drupal Canvas Code Components.

## Usage

Create a new project interactively:

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest
```

```bash
yarn dlx @drupal-canvas/create@latest
```

```bash
pnpm dlx @drupal-canvas/create@latest
```

```bash
bunx @drupal-canvas/create@latest
```

You can also provide the project name as an argument:

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest my-project
```

### Options

| Option          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--template -t` | Template to use when scaffolding the project. One of the predefined templates (currently available: `acquia-nebula`, `balintbrews-canvas-starter`) or URL to custom template's Git repository. |
| `--ref <ref>`   | Custom Git ref to use when cloning the template repository. For example, a branch name or a tag.                                                                                               |
| `--agents -a`   | Comma-separated list of additional agents to support, or `none` to skip compatibility symlink creation.                                                                                        |

### Example

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest my-project --template acquia-nebula
```

Explicitly skip additional agent compatibility symlinks:

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest my-project --template acquia-nebula --agents none
```

Provide additional agent compatibility symlinks without prompting:

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest my-project --template acquia-nebula --agents claude-code,roo
```

If `--agents` is omitted, the CLI keeps the current interactive prompt on TTY
runs. On non-interactive runs, it skips compatibility setup and prints a note.

### `agents` command

Set up compatibility symlinks for additional agent skills directories in an
existing project:

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest agents
```

You can also provide the agents as an argument:

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest agents claude-code,roo
```

Skip compatibility symlinks:

```bash
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest agents none
```

## Development

Drupal Canvas Create is designed to be easily extendable with new templates.

**Templates** are predefined Canvas project starter codebases. Each template
references a Git repository that will be cloned to provide the initial codebase.
To add a template, edit `templates.json` in the package root.

### Working with the codebase

First, build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then you can execute the script locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Alternatively, use `npm run dev` to compile and watch for changes during
development.

⚠️ You must use `my-canvas-project` (provided as default value) as your project
name when running the script from a local directory. (Reasons are explained in
the `.gitignore` file where we had to ignore this directory.)

### Scripts

| Command      | Description                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `start`      | Run the compiled CLI tool from the `dist` folder.                        |
| `dev`        | Compile to the `dist` folder for development while watching for changes. |
| `build`      | Compile to the `dist` folder for production use.                         |
| `type-check` | Run TypeScript type checking without emitting files.                     |
