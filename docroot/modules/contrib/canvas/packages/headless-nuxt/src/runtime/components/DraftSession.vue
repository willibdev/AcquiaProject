/**
 * The Nuxt lifecycle around the draft session: fetches the session state
 * from the module's /api/draft/session route (in-process during SSR) and
 * hands it to the <canvas-draft-session> custom element from
 * @drupal-canvas/headless/client, which owns the machine (expiry timing,
 * the renewal protocol with the embedding host, re-arming after a
 * renewal). Renders nothing when draft mode is off. The element's `path`
 * attribute is bound to the route, so client-side navigations keep the
 * host's status reports and the renew link on the current page. Auto-save
 * refresh events are handled by the module's client plugin instead of
 * reloading the page. The element also reports content height to the embedding
 * host.
 *
 * The slot owns presentation: children marked
 * `data-draft-session-view="active"` show while the session is live and
 * the page is standalone (embedded, the host owns the session chrome);
 * `data-draft-session-view="expired"` children show once the session has
 * expired, embedded or not. A `data-draft-session-renew-link` anchor gets
 * its href pointed at Drupal's renew route for the current path. A
 * headless page that only needs the renewal protocol leaves the slot
 * empty.
