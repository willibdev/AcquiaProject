 * Generates draft-mode preview URLs carrying a signed assertion.

 * The frontend app exchanges the assertion at /oauth/token for an access
 * token bound to that editor, so the preview sees exactly what the editor's
 * own permissions allow — nothing to entitle, nothing to configure.
 *
 * The assertion also carries the draft *session* contract: a validated
 * entry path and a session-wide resource version policy. What the app
 * previews is determined by the entry path and the app's own routing;
 * access control lives entirely in the editor's permissions.
