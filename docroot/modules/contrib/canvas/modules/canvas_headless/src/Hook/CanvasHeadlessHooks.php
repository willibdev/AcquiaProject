   * The module's own baseline: viewing content, which covers published
   * Canvas pages and the Custom Elements API rendering. Declarations for
   * optional modules are harmless — the granularity plugin drops undefined
   * permissions. Two of them come from content_moderation ('view any
   * unpublished content', 'view latest version'), so on sites without that
   * module the baseline narrows to node's own 'view own unpublished
   * content': previews show other authors' unpublished nodes only where a
   * module provides — and declares — a broader view permission.
   *
   * The baseline is a literal list because it cannot be computed. An entity
   * type definition links an access control handler, but the handler does
   * not enumerate the permission strings it consults — permissions carry no
   * machine-readable relationship to entity types, nor to read vs. write.
   * Only the module defining a permission knows whether it is view-only,
   * and that is exactly the judgment the hook delegates: modules providing
   * other entity types declare their own view permissions there.
   *
   * Access decided outside the permission system — node access grants via
   * hook_node_grants() foremost — is outside the ceiling entirely and
   * follows the token's user binding instead; see the hook documentation.

   *   redemption stops, and adding any other grant would widen what this
   *   client can do at the token endpoint,
   * - the confidential flag: a confidential client must authenticate with a
   *   secret the frontend app does not have — the signed assertion is the
   *   credential.
   * Locking grant types also keeps the grant-specific sections (scopes,
   * redirect URIs, PKCE, service user, refresh tokens) permanently hidden,
   * since their visibility follows the grant checkboxes.
   *
   * The secret and third-party fields are hidden outright instead: a secret
   * is never validated for a public client, and third-party consent only
   * exists in redirect-based flows this client can never use, so both
   * fields could only mislead. The expiration field stays editable — the
   * grant caps the issued lifetime regardless — and gets a note saying so.
   *

   * state: redemption looks consumers up by client_id, so an adopted
   * pre-existing consumer carries the same constraints as a provisioned
   * one. Ordered after simple_oauth, whose alter adds the new_secret
