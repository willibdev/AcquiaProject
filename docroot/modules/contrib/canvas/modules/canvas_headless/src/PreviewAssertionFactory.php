/**
 * Mints signed preview assertions (RFC 7523 JWTs).
 *
 * The assertion is the authorization grant of the preview flow: it asserts
 * that a specific editor, authenticated in Drupal, initiated a preview of a
 * specific path moments ago. The frontend app exchanges it at /oauth/token
 * (grant_type urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer) for an access
 * token bound to that editor — see
 * \Drupal\canvas_headless\Grant\PreviewAssertionGrant.
 *
 * Signed RS256 with the same keypair Simple OAuth uses for access tokens.
 * The "typ" header keeps the two token species mutually unmixable: the
 * grant rejects anything but "canvas-headless-preview-assertion+jwt", and
 * the resource server's JWT parsing never yields a valid access token from
 * an assertion.
 *
 * Binding claims, chosen to survive multi-origin topologies (a browser may
 * reach Drupal over one URL while the app's server calls another, so
 * absolute-URL claims would be mint/redeem-asymmetric): "iss" is the site
 * UUID — unique per installation and origin-independent, it refuses
 * assertions from a separately installed site even when that site signs
 * with this site's keypair. It does not fence clones of one installation
 * (clones keep the UUID; config sync requires it) — distinct
 * per-environment signing keypairs do. "azp" binds the assertion to the
 * consumer it was minted for; "aud" is the token endpoint as a path,
 * binding purpose.
