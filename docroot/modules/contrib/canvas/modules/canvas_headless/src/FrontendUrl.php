/**
 * Canonicalizes the configured frontend URL for security-relevant consumers.
 *
 * The active frontend URL feeds an iframe src, a trusted redirect target,
 * and the origin postMessage checks compare against. Two hazards make a
 * naive parse unsafe:
 *
 * - Parser differentials. PHP and browsers disagree about what a URL's host
 *   is, in two distinct ways, and both let the browser navigate to one
 *   origin while Drupal derives another — so the iframe carries the
 *   activation assertion to a site whose messages the host would then
 *   refuse, or worse, that was never the configured site at all.
 *   - Structure: in "https://evil.test\@trusted.example", parse_url reads
 *     the host as trusted.example (everything before the backslash being
 *     userinfo), while a browser folds the backslash to a slash and loads
 *     evil.test. Backslashes, credentials, queries, and fragments have no
 *     place in a base URL and are refused outright.
 *   - Host spelling: browsers rewrite hosts before forming an origin. They
 *     decode percent-encoding, collapse the IPv4 number forms ("0x7f000001",
 *     "2130706433", "127.1" all become "127.0.0.1"), and convert
 *     internationalized names to their ASCII "xn--" form. PHP preserves the
 *     original spelling. Rather than reimplement the URL standard's host
 *     parser, this class accepts only hosts *already* in the form a browser
 *     would produce, and refuses every other spelling. An internationalized
 *     site is configured by its ASCII name — which is exactly the string its
 *     MessageEvents will report.
 * - Path rewriting. Browsers remove literal and percent-encoded dot segments
 *   before navigating, while parse_url() preserves them. Refusing those
 *   segments keeps the configured base URL identical to the browser's URL.
 * - Divergent derivation. The origin and the draft URL must describe the same
 *   site, so both are built from one canonical parse here rather than from the
 *   raw string in two places.
 *
 * The config schema restricts the setting to this same shape on save; this
 * class is the runtime counterpart, so a value that bypassed validation (a
 * settings.php override, a direct config write) still cannot smuggle an
 * executable scheme or an ambiguous host into any sink. Consumers treat
 * NULL as "no frontend configured" and fail closed.

   *   hex ("0x7f000001"), decimal ("2130706433"), octal ("0177.0.0.1"),

   *   begins with a letter. The letter requirement is what refuses the
   *   remaining IPv4 number forms: per the URL standard a host whose last
   *   label parses as a number is an IPv4 address, so "0x7f000001" and
   *   "2130706433" are addresses to a browser and names to PHP.

   * so configure that form instead), trailing dots, and IPv6 literals (whose
   * canonical serialization is its own problem, and which no frontend
