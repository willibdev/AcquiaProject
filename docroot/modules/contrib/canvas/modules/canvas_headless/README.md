# Drupal Canvas Headless

Introduces first-class headless frontend app support to [Drupal Canvas](https://www.drupal.org/project/canvas):
the editor embeds your decoupled frontend app, and editors preview their work rendered by the app itself.

The module is experimental (`lifecycle: experimental`): while the Canvas Headless milestone is in progress, its APIs,
hooks, and configuration may change without a deprecation path.

## Requirements

- [Simple OAuth module](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) (>=6.1.0), with its RSA keypair configured (see
  `/admin/config/people/simple_oauth`). The same keypair signs preview assertions; no additional keys are needed.
- The [Lupus Decoupled](https://lupus-decoupled.org/) CE API stack (`custom_elements`, `lupus_ce_renderer`,
  `lupus_decoupled_ce_api`), declared as module dependencies; it provides the rendered-routes endpoint
  (`/ce-api/{path}`).
- A frontend app built on the Drupal Canvas Headless SDK. The SDK ships as the workspace package
  `@drupal-canvas/headless` (framework-agnostic core) plus one adapter per framework —
  `@drupal-canvas/headless-next` (Next.js), `@drupal-canvas/headless-astro` (Astro),
  `@drupal-canvas/headless-nuxt` (Nuxt), and `@drupal-canvas/headless-tanstack-start` (TanStack Start) — with
  `@drupal-canvas/headless-react` as the shared React binding. The bundled example apps (`examples/next`, `examples/astro`, `examples/nuxt`,
  `examples/tanstack-start`) are working references built on them; see their READMEs for setup. They additionally
  expect JSON:API for listings.

## Setup

1. Install the module. It provisions the OAuth consumer and scope it needs; there is nothing to create manually.
2. Grant `administer canvas headless frontends` to the roles that may manage the site-wide frontend list.
3. Grant `access canvas headless preview` to the editorial roles that should preview through a frontend app. The
   permission lets its holders mint preview credentials for themselves.
4. Open **Headless frontends** in Canvas, and add the frontend app URL, such as `http://localhost:3000`.

Opening an entity in the Canvas editor then loads the first frontend in the list with an active draft session.

In cloned environments, regenerate the Simple OAuth keypair per environment; with shared keys, preview credentials
minted on one clone would redeem on another.

## Browser support

- Chromium-based browsers: works over HTTPS, and without HTTPS on a plain-http `localhost` dev server.
- Firefox: works over HTTPS; fails over plain http, and under "block all third-party cookies" unless the user adds
  a per-site exception for the Drupal site.
- Safari: follows CHIPS availability (unavailable in 18.5–26.1).

## Declaring preview-safe permissions

A preview token carries the editor's own permissions, capped to those declared safe for a read-only preview. The
module's baseline covers core content viewing; if your module defines view permissions that draft previews need,
declare them:

```php
function my_module_canvas_headless_safe_permissions(): array {
  return ['view my_module widgets'];
}
```

An undeclared permission means a preview shows too little, never too much. See `canvas_headless.api.php` for the
hook documentation, including the site-policy `_alter` hook.

## Known limitations

- The rendered-content endpoint serves the default revision: an unpublished entity previews fully, but a published entity's forward
  revision appears only in JSON:API-driven listings (the SDK hydrates working copies), not on pages rendered
  through `fetchPage()`.
- Core JSON:API filtered collections exclude unpublished content regardless of permissions; the example app avoids
  filtered collection queries for draft content.
- Content gated by a view permission not declared preview-safe is invisible in previews until the owning module
  declares it.
- Editors need view access to the entity they preview, not only edit access; without it the preview fails to start.
- The first URL in the site-wide frontend list is used for previews; reorder the list to change the active app.
  Enabling the module replaces the Drupal-rendered preview for every entity editing context. An entity without a
  canonical URL, or one the active app does not serve, shows a preview-start failure.
