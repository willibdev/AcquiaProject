  /**
   * Using classes should implement this to provide test cases.
   *
   * The test case format:
   *  - 'permissions': Array of permissions the current user needs for the test.
   *    'access content' is always included.
   *  - 'entity': Array with the keys:
   *    - 'type': The entity type to create at the start of the test.
   *    - 'values' The field values to pass when creating the entity.
   *  - 'actions' => An array of actions to perform. Each entry is a string with
   *    just an action name, or an array where the first value is the action
   *    name and the second value the argument(s) to pass to the action.
   *    See EntityActionsTrait for available actions. Each action also has
   *    access to a 'context' array where 'entity' is the actual created entity.
   *    Actions are assumed to do something with this entity, and keep that
   *    reference valid with the latest instance of that entity whenever
   *    possible. Actions may also put other data in the context for use by
   *    subsequent actions, much like the sandbox in Batch API.
   *  - 'access_map': Many tests perform asserts on entity operations at the end
   *    and this is a map of the operation name to test and the expected result.
   *    The result may be a boolean or an AccessResultInterface. If the access
   *    result has a 'reason' string, it is also compared, else it is only
   *    asserted that the object type is the same.
   *    There is also an 'assert-operations-access' action for tests needing
   *    to perform assertions part way through the test.
   *
   * @return iterable<string, array{permissions: string[], entity: array{type: string, values: array<string, mixed>,actions: array<mixed>, access_map: <array<string, bool|\Drupal\Core\Access\AccessResultInterface>>}}>
   *   Test cases in the format described above.
